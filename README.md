# Classifying handwritten Digits usimg neural network

* The neural network we will build classifies the handwritten digits in their 10 classes (0, .., 9). 
* It does so based on internal parameters that need to have a correct value for the classification to work well. 
* This "correct value" is learned through a training process which requires a "labeled dataset" with images and the associated correct answers.
